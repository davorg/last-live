# Last Live

Last Live is a React application that allows users to explore their top artists
from LastFM and track which ones they have seen live. The app fetches data from
the LastFM API and provides an interactive interface to mark artists as "seen"
or "not seen." It also displays a pie chart summarizing the percentage of
artists seen live.

## Features

- Fetch top artists from LastFM based on username and time period.
- Mark artists as "seen live" or "not seen."
- View a dynamic pie chart showing the percentage of artists seen live.
- Data persistence using LocalStorage.
